# README #

VocalEyes Vibrato is a dynamic web app that provides vibrato visualizations for musicians
(both singers and instrumentalists).

### What is this repository for? ###

This repo includes both the front end and back end, which are both served via Flask on top of WSGI.

### How do I get set up? ###

This app uses Flask with a WSGI server. It is written in Python 3 (I'm thinking about switching to Python 2). Other required libraries are included in requirements.txt, which has a lot of extra libraries that aren't actually being used. I'm working on setting it up to use virtualenv and will update requirements.txt and these instructions.

#### Deployment ####

The app is set up to be deployed on Heroku, which automatically installs all the needed dependencies via requirements.txt and Procfile.
